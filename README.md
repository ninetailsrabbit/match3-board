# Getting started üöÄ

To start creating your **Match3** game you have available 3 pillars provided from this plugin to build it:

- üî≥ The `Match3Board` node handles the core game mechanics, including grid size, piece setup, and swap movement mode.
- üíé The `PieceUI` node provides the visual representation and interactive behavior of game pieces. You can customize it or create your own variations.
- üìù The `PieceDefinitionResource` defines the properties and behaviors of each piece type, such as its match logic and special abilities.

# Editor preview ü™≤

This feature provides a preview of your game board before it's fully initialized. This allows you to:

- **_Assess Layout:_** Visualize the size and layout of your board.
- **_Add Empty Spaces:_** Easily adjust the spacing between game pieces.
- **_Experiment with Textures:_** Test different textures for cells and pieces without affecting the final game.

You have available default textures on this plugin to visualize a preview in the editor, feel free to use your own ones.

‚ö†Ô∏è _This preview is temporary and will be removed when the game starts_ ‚ö†Ô∏è

With the `preview enabled`, any changes you make to the board's parameters _(like grid size or piece definitions)_ will be instantly reflected in the preview window. This allows you to quickly iterate and experiment with different configurations

# GridCellUI

Each square in the preview represents a GridCellUI node. This node serves as a visual representation of a cell within the game grid and is not designed for customization.
