# üì¶ Installation

1. [Download Latest Release](https://github.com/ninetailsrabbit/match3-board/releases/latest)
2. Unpack the `ninetailsrabbit.match3_board` folder into your `/addons` folder within the Godot project
3. Enable this addon within the Godot settings: `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`

To better understand what branch to choose from for which Godot version, please refer to this table:
|Godot Version|match3-board Branch|match3-board Version|

# Getting started üöÄ

To start creating your **Match3** game you have available 3 pillars provided from this plugin to build it:

- üî≥ The `Match3Board` node handles the core game mechanics, including grid size, piece setup, and swap movement mode.
- üíé The `PieceUI` node provides the visual representation and interactive behavior of game pieces. You can customize it or create your own variations.
- üìù The `PieceDefinitionResource` defines the properties and behaviors of each piece type, such as its match logic and special abilities.

# Editor preview ü™≤

This feature provides a preview of your game board before it's fully initialized. This allows you to:

- **_Assess Layout:_** Visualize the size and layout of your board.
- **_Add Empty Spaces:_** Easily adjust the spacing between game pieces.
- **_Experiment with Textures:_** Test different textures for cells and pieces without affecting the final game.

You have available default textures on this plugin to visualize a preview in the editor, feel free to use your own ones. The nodes that are drawn are not the scenes that the board uses in the game, they are just sprites.

‚ö†Ô∏è _This preview is temporary and will be removed when the game starts_ ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Parameters

- **Preview grid in editor:** Enable or disable the preview
- **Clean current preview:** Removes the current preview from the editor
- **Preview pieces:** The textures to preview in the grid randomly placed on each generation
- **Odd cell texture:** The texture to place in odd cell positions in the board
- **Even cell texture:** The texture to place in even cell positions in the board
- **Empty cells:** Set empty cells where a piece shall not be drawn in the shape of Vector2i(row, column)

# Board size

---

## Parameters

- **Grid width:** The row width of the grid, a width of 7 means that 7 pieces will be drawed by row
- **Grid height:** The column height of the grid, a height o 8 means that 8 pieces will be drawed by column
- **Cell size:** The size of the cell in the world in the shape of Vector2(x, y). It's recommended to keep this values equals for better display
- **Cell offset:** The offset from the corner if you want to create more space.

‚ÑπÔ∏è _\_With the `preview enabled`, any changes you make to the board's parameters _(like grid size or piece definitions)\_ will be instantly reflected in the preview window. This allows you to quickly iterate and experiment with different configurations\_\_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è

# Match configuration

WIP

# GridCellUI

Each square in the preview represents a `GridCellUI` node. This node serves as a visual representation of a cell within the game grid and is not designed for customization _(although nothing prevents you from doing so)_

The Swaps between pieces are done via this `GridCellUI` node so **_the pieces are never directly interacted with_**, it is the cells that contain the checks and commands to see if the swap is possible or not.

## Position

To obtain the position of a cell you have access to variables `row`, `column` and method `board_position()`. This method returns a `Vector2i(row, column)`

## Empty cell

If the position of this cell match with any of the `empty_cells` vectors from the `Match3Board`, this cell will change the variable `can_contain_piece` to false and you can choose if draw the background texture or not with the variable `draw_background_texture`.
